### Ray Casting Setup




### Scene Animation

* The SDF combination operations Intersection, Subtraction, and Smooth Blend
	1. Smooth Union (blend) used to create motorcycle handle
	2. 
	3.
	4.

* Raymarch optimization by way of bounding volumes around SDFs, arranged in a Bounding Volume Hierarchy 
	1. Spheremarching done, manually arranged in bounding volume hierarchy

* Animation of at least two scene attributes such as color, position, scale, twist, rotation, texture, or anything else you can think of
	1. 
	2.

* At least two functions mentioned in the Toolbox Functions slides used for animation
 	1. Sin wave to change position up down
 	2. 

* Procedural texturing using toolbox functions and/or noise functions:
	Road surface marking were generated using square wave. 
	Where the output of the square wave is greater than 0, a block was placed and vice versa,
	to achieve the effect of markings made in regular intervals.

* Shading that involves surface normal computation: Lambert Reflective Shading

### GUI Features

Bike Speed: The user can toggle the bike speed between Low, Medium, and High. Medium is the default.
Background Color: The user can change the background color between
